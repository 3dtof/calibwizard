Introduction
============

The following document deals with the calibration of 3D depth sensor chipsets provided by Texas Instruments. It is written in Python 2.7. The calibrations supported are as follows:
	- Lens Calibration
	- Common Phase Offset Calibration
	- HDR Common Phase Offset Calibration
	- PixelWise Phase Offset Calibration
	- Non Linearity Calibration
	- Temperature Calibration 
	
Calibration is a complex process, an advanced operation that only needs to be performed occasionally.  Readers are advised to read through this entire section before attempting calibration.
